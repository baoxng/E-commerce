## Development

I would have to say the development of this project was challenging as I was rewatching class videos over the course of two days before starting project. I was having trouble with the post request for my products it was the biggest challenge that I had. After troubleshoot various times I realized that it was a postman problem and not with my codes. I was really frustrated, but the rewarding knowing that it wasn't anything I did incorrectly. Check out the documentation on how this application works down below.
